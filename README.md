# Password Generator

## Description

Password generators are software tools used to create random and/or customised passwords. They provide users with stronger passwords and greater security.

This project uses Javascript to create a password generator program. When the program is run, it first asks users to input their ideal password character length. Then it goes through a series of prompts asking whether the user would like their password to contain lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters, thus allowing the user to customise their password as they wish. Finally, the custom password is generated, then it is displayed in the text area for the user to use as they see fit.
