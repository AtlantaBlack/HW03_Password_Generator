# BCS HW 03 - Password Generator

## Description

Password generators are software tools used to create random and/or customised passwords. They provide users with stronger passwords and greater security.

This project uses Javascript to create a password generator program. When the program is run, it first asks users to input their ideal password character length. Then it goes through a series of prompts asking whether the user would like their password to contain lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters, thus allowing the user to customise their password as they wish. Finally, the custom password is generated, then it is displayed in the text area for the user to use as they see fit.

As a newbie to Javascript and the programming world in general, there were a number of challenges I faced when creating this program, the biggest being how to think logically and how to read programming language. Other hurdles I came across included figuring out the correct order of operations, choosing which variables to use and why, understanding how Javascript worked (broadly speaking), and how to debug when errors arose.
